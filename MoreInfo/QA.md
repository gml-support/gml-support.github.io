# Q&A

> 1, Why delete function information?

~~Because I think the effect of displaying function information on code snippets is very poor, I would like to implement it after I make a language server, I started to remove the function information in the code snippet from 1.3.3~~

In 1.4.0, a language server has been made and the rest will be added in subsequent releases

> 2, About GMLive

In 1.3.4, I add `GMLive` syntaxes, but I do not have this plugin, so it does not have any tests.
