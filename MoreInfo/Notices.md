# Notices

The following functions are temporarily not added:

New in GameMaker 8.1:

draw_self() This command is exactly the same as draw_sprite_ext() except it will use the instances own variables to draw itself (x,y, scale, angle etc.) This provides the same action as if the instance was draw without a script.

get_function_address('function_name') Returns the address of a GameMaker function. This can be passed to DLL's so the can call directly into GameMaker.

.gmk and .gm81 file is GameMaker 8.1 project file! 
The file can not be edited by the text editor!
This is just to distinguish the GameMaker version.
